All the code presented was implemented for a college work at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro.
The objective was to benchmark the performance of the mergesort algorithm.

Two implementations are provided, one iterative and the classic recursive algorithm.

Multiple executions of the ordenation are done with a bigger array each execution and the results are stored in the file mergesort.txt where each line contains the array size and the time to order the array in seconds
